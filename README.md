# Pirate Game #

## Description ##

This is a multiplayer game coded in Pygame (my first time ever using Pygame) based on the school game Pirate Game - Christmas Version. 

## How to Play ##

To play with someone else, your opponent will either have to run this game on their device or print the Pirate Game on a piece of paper (that is what I did).

Once you click through the title screen, you can click the *PLAY* button in the menu to start the game.

Click *GENERATE* and tell your opponent the coordinate generated.

Keep generating coordinates until you receive an item.

When you receive an item, a message at the bottom will tell you what you can do with the item.
(A full list of all items is shown below this section)

The person with the most points at the end of the game *WINS*!

## RULES ##

The Pirate Game is an activity where each person in the game places a set of symbols and values in a 7 by 7 blank grid. The grid is labelled A-G across the columns and 1-7 down the rows. The program randomly generates the grid for you at the start of the game; other players will have to fill out their Pirate Game sheet with all the 49 symbols manually before starting. The activity then starts with the host selecting a grid reference, lets say F1. The class then cross off that grid reference and get whatever symbol/value is in that grid ref. If they get a value they add this to their 'score' and this is kept as a running total throughout the game. If they get a symbol, there is a particular purpose to each of these and the players are to either: put their hand up if their symbol has a tick next to it or to use that symbol in the way stated below.

## Items ##

### Numbers ###
These just add a certain amount of points to your overall score.

### Grinch ✔️ ##
Rob someone's points

### Pudding ✔️ ###
Kill someone (not literally, just reset their points).

### Snowball ✔️ ###
Wipe out a row's scores (works only in a classroom with many students playing).

### Mistletoe ✔️ ###
Kiss and swap scores.

### Christmas Tree ✔️ ###
Choose next square.

### Elf ###
Blocks an attack (works with ROB/STEAL, KILL, GIFT, SWAP). The other player can use an elf to block an attack that you have reflected to them.

### Bauble ###
Reflects an attack (works with ROB/STEAL, KILL, GIFT, SWAP). The other player can also use a bauble to reflect an attack that you have reflected to them.

### Burnt Turkey ###
YOU go to zero.

Double your score.

### Christmas Hat ###
Bank your score (it is now safe for the rest of the game).
